# Stage 2 Application: Section 4 (16k words)
---
## NOTES:
Detailed project plan using the following headings
Think of this as an efficacy project
But with the regulatory pieces in place too
Phase 2: Things which get funded: Development and clinical evaluation
- Research and development to enable clinical use
- Acquisition of data to train the technology
- CE marking
- IP protection
- Health economics
- PPI research

These sections need their own documents

## Finance analysis
## Patient data use

NOTES: Describe any known limitations of the data used and algorithms deployed by the AI solution. Include an ethical examination of how the data would be used, and how it would comply with the AI Code of Conduct. Explain how the product’s performance would be validated and how it would be integrated into health and care provision. Demonstrate that security of the data is integral to its design. Please include details of how you will monitor and report patient safety or data issues, including any recovery plan.

## Ethics and regulatory approvals

TODO: does this need ethics? tackle this separately by arguing for a training database as part of the product; maybe work toward finding a partner to host this with (ATI?); this then needs approval and we specifically seek that

## Intellectual property

NOTES
??emphasise that the opportunity here is to create a framework into which forecasts of different mechanisms van be deployed; maybe argue against IP; 
??keep the system 'open' to encourage local adaption and innovation
??argue that keeping this state of the art precludes making the actual forecast protected

> All background and any potential foreground IP arising from the project must be described in the application. An initial freedom to operate opinion must be provided, referencing any third parties’ rights which may affect the implementation of your device or technology. A strategy should be proposed for how third party rights will be managed to allow for further development, implementation and commercial exploitation. Provide details of any new types of IP that may arise during the project, including ownership arrangements and management of the IP.
> IP arrangements between collaboration partners, and with consultancies and sub-contractors must be regulated by appropriate agreements. The Lambert Toolkit provides model agreements for collaborations between universities and companies.
> Please include details of the intended market, barriers to entry, and competitor analysis as well as details of your sales strategy/channels and marketing plans. Include a pricing strategy. Provide any details of market traction, interested customers and their potential value for the company, and/or any income already being generated. Market opportunities, both domestic and global can be explored.

## Dissemination and NHS adoption strategy

We will disseminate our findings to 
- patient groups
- the public
- the NHS
- academic community


Expected output
- open source software project?
- REDcap style product where you can deploy this yourself if you wish but the company might come and do that for you ('consultancy approach')


> Please describe the planned outputs of the research and how they may lead to short and longer-term NHS and patient impacts. As far as possible, indicate anticipated timescales for these benefits and a quantitative estimate of their scale. Impacts may include, but are not restricted to - patient benefit; healthcare staff benefits; changes in NHS service (including efficiency savings); commercial return (which could contribute to economic growth); public wellbeing.
> Describe how the outputs of the research will be communicated and to whom. Identify key stakeholders, and your plans for engaging them. To realise impact, it is unlikely that simply making outputs available will be sufficient. Please consider and outline the active approach you will take to engaging key parties to disseminate the work.
> Present a specific strategy for adoption of the technology into the NHS. Describe the process by which the technology will enter the healthcare environment, including how your solution will be acknowledged, selected and introduced for use in the health and care service or wider society. Detail what current and future barriers to adoption are likely to be encountered, and a strategy for overcoming them. Where possible, consider how your solution will be adopted and implemented longer term, and what efforts and investment are likely to be needed beyond the project to achieve widespread NHS adoption.
