05 The team
explain how the team has worked together before
perhaps provide a timeline of the work we have done to date

training data
- work primarily with critical care but then use data from other wards (and ?GOSH) to show that it can scale

offer to accelerate the project; acknowledge that the need for this project is more acute and that 2 years seems a really long time; suggest that if funded we would reduce the duration by 50% and hire 2x the staff
