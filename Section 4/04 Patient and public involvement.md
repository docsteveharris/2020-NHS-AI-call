## Patient and public involvement

TODO: work out how to do this; do we need to think about how the eventual system will be used? at what point will the forecast results be shared with the clinical team and how will the be transmitted to the patient? do we need an adviser?

NOTES: Evidence must be presented of early engagement with end users (e.g. NICE, clinical commissioning groups, etc.) and their provisional interest in the product.
Patients, carers, service users and the public can also be involved in every stage of the project, from developing a proposal through to dissemination and evaluation. Describe how Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) activities have been included throughout the project lifecycle. You should describe who has been involved and why this is appropriate, what role(s) they have played and what influence or change has happened as result of their involvement.Public co-applicants We encourage the inclusion of public co-applicants, where appropriate. Please include a clear description of their role and the reasons why a public co-applicant is joining the team. For further information please access the 'Public Co-Applicants in Research' guidance https://www.invo.org.uk/posttypepublication/public-co-applicants-in-research-guidance-on-roles-and-responsibilities/. Resources for evaluating impact and reporting of PPI You will also need to describe how you will record and evaluate the impact PPI has on the research. The level of evaluation should be proportionate to the level and complexity of the proposed PPI activities. The following resources may be useful as they provide different frameworks for assessing impact and reporting PPI: Evaluating PPI http://www.phwe.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Guidance-on-evaluating-Public-Involvement-in-research.pdf Public Involvement Impact Assessment Framework http://piiaf.org.uk/ GRIPP2 for reporting PPI https://www.bmj.com/content/358/bmj.j345
