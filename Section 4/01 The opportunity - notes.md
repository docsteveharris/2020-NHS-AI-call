## The opportunity

---
Notes
- compare/contrast with current technology
- explain advantages of our approach
- explain current state of the work
- notes on the specific need with COVID to manage beds better
- overall justification of the importance of this work
- need to show the tech works; but that you need now to develop this into a platform that can be deployed and tested: i.e. again this efficacy not effectiveness work
- specifically model a 2 patient flow (blue and green)
- specifically model 'surge recovery': work to the last minute; restart with the minimum of risk

#### The Opportunity

##### NHS unmet clinical need & market pain

Provide a clear explanation of the health or social care problem to be addressed, the impact on patients as well as health and social care services, and how the proposed work would fill a demonstrable evidence gap. Please also provide a description of how your AI solution will support the NHS Long Term Plan, NHSX strategic priorities and/or wider government priorities including the Industrial Strategy grand challenges or resource efficiency. Please report market size, any related trend or forecast, patient population affected, NHS cost burden, and state of the art.

- [ ] TODO find evidence that hospitals are supposed to run at occupancy X and then compare to just in time literature and talk about running them higher

##### Benefit to patients, the NHS and the wider population

Provide a clear case of how the proposed device, technology or intervention will change clinical practice and provide benefit to patients (such as reduced mortality or morbidity, improved quality of life, reduced misdiagnosis, and improved patient outcomes and experiences). Potential cost savings for the NHS should also be provided.

Clearly articulate the expected benefit to patients, the NHS and/or social care settings and the wider community. Please note that your AI solution must have the potential to be cost effective and meet at least one of the following criteria

* Improvement in patient outcomes
* Improvement in patient experience
* Improvement in operational efficiency

Describe the impact the project aims to achieve. Impact may include but is not restricted to:

* Patient & public wellbeing (improved quality of life, improved safety, improved satisfaction with care, improved independent living, improved health, slowed progression of ill health)
* Clinical benefits (improved accuracy of diagnosis, improved detection rates, reduced false positive/negatives, improved health data quality/availability; improved effectiveness of the therapy, improved availability of the therapy, improved ability to stabilise/manage the condition)
* Staff & service provision benefits (improved staff capacity, improved staff capabilities-knowledge and skills-, simplified/improved care pathway, more efficient care pathway, reduced number of procedures, reduced waiting times)
* Economic benefits & commercial ROI (reduced service delivery costs, improved organisation/service cost control, reduced treatment cost to patient, reduced staffing cost)
* Social and policy benefits (change in policy, change in professional guidance, improved awareness)
