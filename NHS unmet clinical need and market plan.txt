NHS unmet clinical need and market plan
Please describe the problem that you are addressing with your AI solution. Provide a clear explanation of the health or social care problem to be addressed, the impact on patients as well as health and social care services, and how this development work would fill a demonstrable evidence gap. Please also provide a description of how your AI solution will support the NHS E/I Long Term Plan, NHSX strategic priorities and/or wider government priorities including the Industrial Strategy grand challenges or resource efficiency. Please report market size, any related trend or forecast, patient population affected, NHS cost burden, state of the art.

25,475 operations were cancelled on the day of surgery in NHS England (NHS-E) in just one quarter in 2018: the highest number in two decades. Last winter, NHS-E recommended that all elective surgery to be cancelled in January to aid with winter bed pressures.(M Gillies, 2018) Yet even in winter NHS operating theatres are often labelled inefficient. Major surgery in our own hospitals is routinely delayed until after the daily 9am ‘bed meeting’ that reports whether ICU beds are available for high risk surgery while the patients, surgeons, scrub nurses and  anaesthetists are all ready to go from 730am. 
We found in 245 NHS hospitals that on average 10% of surgical admissions had been previously cancelled (more in hospitals with fewer ICU beds, and more emergency work).(D Wong 2018) On-the-day cancellations for bed capacity should become a ‘never event’ in the NHS. 
This ambition requires high quality bed demand forecasts. These enable the workforce by putting the information they need in their hands at the right time. Staffing can be flexed, patients forewarned, or schedules re-adjusted to improve efficiency.
 
We have already built and deployed a prototype bed demand forecasting model. This has been deployed to predict bed demand for Great Ormond Street Hospital’s cardio-thoracic ICU since 2012. It produces a real time, hyper-local, 7-day forecast of bed demand. In 2018-9, we collaborated with University College Hospital’s digital platform team to (1)  generalise our model to work for any ward in a complex network of flows, and (2) start to adapt the technology for different levels of digital ‘readiness’. As per NHS-X strategies, the platform is interoperable, robust and scalable. We now seek support to update our prototype with state of the art ‘machine learned’ clinical features, and to generate the safety and efficacy data for deployment across the NHS.
